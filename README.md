MLOPS Template

The recommended directory structure for MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) projects can vary depending on the specific tools, frameworks, and practices used. However, here's a common and flexible directory structure that you can use as a starting point:

project_root/
│
├── bin/
│
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   └── parameters.yaml
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── external/
│
├── docs/
│
├── notebooks/
│
├── scripts/
│
├── src/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── data_preprocessing.py
│   │   └── data_loading.py
│   │
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── feature_engineering.py
│   │   └── feature_selection.py
│   │
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── model_training.py
│   │   └── model_evaluation.py
│   │
│   └── utils/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── logger.py
│       └── other_utils.py
│
├── tests/
│
├── README.md
│
└── requirements.txt

Let's briefly explain the purpose of each directory:

bin/: Executable scripts or binaries.

config/: Configuration files and settings for your project.

data/: This directory contains raw, processed, and external data.

docs/: Documentation for the project.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), experimentation, and documentation.

scripts/: Any scripts that are used in the project but aren't part of the main codebase.

src/: Source code for your machine learning pipeline.
    data/: Code related to data loading and preprocessing.
    features/: Code for feature engineering and selection.
    models/: Code for defining, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
    utils/: Utility functions and helper code.

tests/: Unit tests and integration tests for your code.

README.md: Project documentation, including setup instructions, usage, and any other relevant information.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for your project.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and scale your MLOps project. Keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and tools used in your project.
