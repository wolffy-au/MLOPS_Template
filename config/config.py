# Example config.py
# This file often contains settings and configuration parameters for your project. These could include things like paths to data directories, model hyperparameters, API endpoints, database connection strings, and other configurable options. It is usually a Python file containing variables or dictionaries with configuration information.

# DATA_DIR = '/path/to/data'
# MODEL_PARAMS = {
#     'learning_rate': 0.001,
#     'num_layers': 3,
#     'hidden_units': 128
# }
# API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.example.com'

# Example config.py with placeholder for secret
# Secrets and sensitive information: Configuration files might also include placeholders or references to sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, and other secrets. However, it's a common best practice not to store actual secrets in version control. Instead, use environment variables or a secure configuration management tool to handle secrets.

# API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
