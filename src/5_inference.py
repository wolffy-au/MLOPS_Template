# 5. Inference Script (inference.py):
# This script is used for making predictions or inferences using a deployed model.
# It may include code for handling input data, calling the model, and processing the output.
# Part of the deployment pipeline to ensure that the deployed model functions as expected.

# from models.model_loading import load_models

# print("Loading previous model")
# model_name = "finalised_model"
# [model] = load_models(model_name)

# data = [
#     # Add sample data here
#     ]

# for x in data:
#     # test the model with 1 row
#     print(model.predict([x]))
